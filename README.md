# tableau-dashboard-projects
Welcome to my collection of Tableau Dashboard Projects! This repository showcases various interactive and insightful dashboards created using Tableau, designed to explore and visualize real-world datasets across domains such as business intelligence, marketing, sales, healthcare, and more.

Each project demonstrates the use of data cleaning, data transformation, and visual storytelling techniques to extract meaningful insights and present them in an easy-to-understand visual format. The goal of these dashboards is to enable data-driven decision-making by providing clear, dynamic, and actionable visualizations.
